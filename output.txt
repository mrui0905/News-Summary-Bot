.Rescuers are searching a vast swath of the North Atlantic for a missing tourist submersible, the Titan, that vanished while taking wealthy passengers on a voyage to the wreck of the Titanic. With only 96 hours of air supply, the Canadian and U.S. authorities have been scrambling to find the five people on board, including a British billionaire, a Pakistani-born businessman and a French explorer. U.S. and Canadian aircraft have searched more than 7,600 square miles of open sea while the Canadian military has dropped sonar buoys to listen for any sounds that may come from the Titan. A French research ship has been dispatched to the area with its own deep-sea diving robot and U.S. President Joe Biden is reportedly watching the search efforts closely.

.A submersible vessel carrying one pilot and four passengers has been missing since Sunday while on a deep-sea tour to view the wreckage of the Titanic. The vessel's oxygen supply is expected to run out Thursday and, if it is on the ocean floor, rescuers say a sub-to-sub rescue is unlikely. If the vessel is bobbing on the ocean surface, experts say it will be difficult to spot, as it is a small vessel far out in the ocean. Moving ships and equipment to the large search area takes time.
